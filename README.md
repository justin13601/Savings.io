# Savings.io

The COVID-19 pandemic has forever changed the lives of billions of people across the world. As a direct result of the economic shutdown that followed the pandemic, the unemployment rate in Canada more than doubled from 5.6% in February 2020 to a record high 13.7% in May 2020 [1]. With so many jobs lost, many people found themselves without their pre-pandemic financial support. An emergency savings fund that one would accumulate throughout their career can drastically reduce the financial impacts of such a disaster. Additionally, along with the ever-increasing popularity of freelance work amongst students, it is all-the-more important to cultivate a sense of financial literacy with savings and investments.

Savings.io is a webapp designed to strategically help students and others set aside a small amount of money each month towards an emergency savings fund through the use of an extensive cost-of-living dataset. It also advocates for financial investment education by providing resources and links to guides and articles. Finally, it is able to return US securities determined through a ML sentiment analysis model (VADER) to be performing "well", which acts as a good starting point for beginner traders.
